## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
-I set out this module to better understand what I didn't get the first time around, along with the proper terminology when describing code. Enumerable and anything nested usually gave me a lot of trouble so I took the extra time to focus on these areas this time around. I also noticed halfway through that I struggled with anything that didn't fit the mold of coding that I was familiar with. Pairing with someone more advanced was a way for me to get past this.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
- Nested data, or enumerable within enumerable were very tricky for me to understand and I will be using some of my time during break to continue practicing with them to really commit them to memory.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

What did you learn from your independent projects?
-When to stop staring at a method and when to start googling and looking for help online. Projects were definitely not my strong suit at the beginning of my time at Turing. Now that I have had some more practice with them, I am more calm and am able to attack it with a logical approach instead of struggling at the beginning to even begin writing code. Having a proper planning and setup session before the project is the best way to map out your plan of attack when it comes to writing the skeleton and finishing the project.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
-The importance of github, this time around during the paired projects, there was a ton of times where we had to work at different locations. During my first time through the module, my pair projects almost always got the work done while being together. Being separate and breaking down the projects into sections was such an amazing way to see how normal projects should go, along with the proper git flow.
## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
-I really enjoyed the opportunity to come to the board and draw/teach my git picture map. The git map that was shown me during my first time through mod one has helped me more than I ever thought was possible so to be able to give that nugget of information to the rest of the class really made me feel like I was contributing to everyone else's learning.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
-By being open and willing to do whatever it takes to learn the new material, while still being available to anyone who might need help, because I know there will be plenty of times during the next module where I will be needing help.
